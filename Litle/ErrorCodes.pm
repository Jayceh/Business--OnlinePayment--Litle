This module provides a method to lookup extended codes to Litle & Co API responses

Takes the result code returned in your Litle response.  Returns a 
hashref containing three keys, C<reason>, C<status>, and C<notes> (which may be empty) if
the lookup is successful, undef otherwise.  This allows for more descriptive error messages, as well as categorization into hard and soft failure types.
